Description of files:

You will need to have R installed to load these files.

food_data_round.RData contains an R object "pdat" that contains information scrapped from DAQTOOLS.

pdat is a list, and each member of the list is a data-frame representing information for a single round of Food Club. 

The list is 2962 long. pdat[[2962]] contains information from round 6568 (April 30th 2017).

If you can see the pdat[[2962]], the rest should be self-explanatory but PM me if you need clarifications.

Thanks,
FC_STATS
